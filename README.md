# Covid-19-Data-Exploration-using-SQL
This project involves an in-depth exploration of COVID-19 data using SQL. The dataset includes information about COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations across various countries and continents. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as death percentages, infection rates, and vaccination coverage.

<h2>Key SQL Scripts</h2>
<p>- Data Cleaning: Initial scripts to filter out irrelevant data and ensure consistency in the dataset.</p>
<p>- Total Cases vs. Total Deaths: Analysis to determine the likelihood of dying if infected with COVID-19.</p>
<p>- Total Cases vs. Population: Calculation of the percentage of the population that got infected.</p>
<p>- Infection Rate Analysis: Identification of countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.</p>
<p>- Death Count Analysis: Examination of countries and continents with the highest death counts per population.</p>
<p>- Global Analysis: Aggregated global metrics to understand the overall impact of COVID-19.</p>
<p>- Vaccination Progress: Insights into vaccination coverage, including the percentage of the population vaccinated over time.</p>
